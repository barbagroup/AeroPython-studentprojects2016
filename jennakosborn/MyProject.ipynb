    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of finite wings is critical for the application of potential flow for real-life scenarios. The panel methods we have been using in class have been dealing with an inifinte 2D wing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A method that can be used to assess the lift on a 3D wing shape is the **Vortex Lattice Method** (VLM). The VLM panels the top surface of the wing into square or tetrahedrals. Once the top surface of the wing is panelled. A \"bound\" votex-sheet is placed 1/4 chord of the panel from the leading edge. Then trailing vortices are added to each end of the bound vortex sheet to give the effect of the trailing vortices. This creates a horse shoe vortex effect for a single panel. The circulation strength is assumed to be constant over the horseshoe vortex. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the 2D panel method, the circulation strength of the vortex sheet can be solved by a linear equation with the normal velocity components adding up to equal zero. The model below assumes a planar wing (no cambering) and that the wing is thin enough to ignore the the curvature to the cross-sectional airfoil, thus making it a 2D problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### History of VLM \n",
    "\n",
    "Ludwig Prandtl and his collegues developed the first practical theory for a model for a finite wing. His model, the Lifting-Line theory is still used for early calculations for finite wing characteristics. His theory involves a single vortex sheet that runs along the span of the wing with two \"Free-trailing\" vortex filaments at the ends of the vortex sheet like a giant horseshoe vortex. This can be expanded into an infinte number of these horseshoe vortices along the span of the wing so that there can be a varying strength circulation along the span as seen in Figure 1. \n",

    "This Lifting Line theory is a pretty good representation of straight wings, but falls short for low aspect ratio wings, swept wings, and Delta wings. On these shapes a more complicated model is required for a better representation for the aerodynamic characteristics. One of these more complicated models is the VLM. \n",

    "Thie model approximates the the continuous distribution of bound vorticity of the wing a a finite number of horseshoe vortices. The geometry is broken up into panels on which these horseshoe vortices are placed. The bound vortex part of the horseshoe vortex is placed at 1/4 chord on the panel and aligned with the panel's local sweepback angle. The ends of the horseshoe vortices are aligned parallel to the y axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The normal velocity is required to be zero by this model and can be used to solve for the individual panel circulation strength. This boundary condition is applied to a control point on the panel which is located at the center of the panel in the x direction and 3/4 chord in the y direction as seen in Figure 2. "

This input can be left as 0.\n",
