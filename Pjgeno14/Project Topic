Project Topic

I would like to compare the lift and drag components of a rigid bird wing vs a membranous bat wing using xflr5. I will use the software to calculate the lift and drag at various angles of attack for each animal and compare them. I will also compare the pressure coefficients of each animal's wings to get a field consistent with the calculated lift values.
